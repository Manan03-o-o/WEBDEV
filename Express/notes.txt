ðŸš€ Node & npm Scripts â€” Quick Notes
1. Running files directly
node filename.js


Runs a file directly with Node.js.

Use this for quick tests or utility scripts.

Doesnâ€™t depend on package.json.

2. npm scripts

Defined in the "scripts" section of package.json.
Example:

"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js",
  "dev": "nodemon index.js",
  "test": "echo \"No tests yet\""
}

3. npm start

Special built-in shortcut for the "start" script.

Runs with just:

npm start


Equivalent to:

npm run start


Commonly used for production mode (stable run, no auto-reload).

4. npm run dev

Runs the "dev" script from package.json.

Must use run because only start and test are shortcuts.

Usually used for development mode (with nodemon, extra logs, etc.):

"dev": "nodemon index.js"

5. Why run is needed for dev

npm treats only two scripts specially:

npm start = npm run start

npm test = npm run test

All others need npm run <name>.

6. When to use what

node filename.js â†’ quick test of a file.

npm run dev â†’ development mode (auto-restart with nodemon).

npm start â†’ production mode (stable, clean run).

âœ… Golden Rule:

Dev mode â†’ npm run dev

Prod mode â†’ npm start

One-off scripts â†’ node filename.js

Want me to also add a sample package.json template (with start, dev, and a test script) at the end of your notes so you can reuse it anytime?
